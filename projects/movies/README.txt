To compile and run this program on os1 type:

    gcc --std=gnu99 -o main main.c

Then to execute the program type:

    ./main {movies csv file}

The bracket portion above represents where to put the movie csv file being used.
My zip file contains only main.c and README.txt because from my understanding for 
grading a different csv file will be used. 

To my knowledge everything works according to the instructions :)
